During my time at [CashApp](https://cash.app/)/[Square](https://squareup.com/ca/en), I lead the rollout of [Spinnaker](https://spinnaker.io/) to improve [Continuous Delivery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery). I wrote about the process of doing so in detail [here](https://cashapp.github.io/2021-03-25/rolling-out-org-wide-changes).
